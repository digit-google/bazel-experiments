Abstract:
---------

A fifth example that demonstrate how to build PIE-optimized ELF executables
and PIC-optimized ELF shared libraries in a single build invocation.
Where the common library sources are generated by a genrule().

Compared to the fourth example, this one supports having a `unique_genrule()`
target configured from any build configuration, including the "unique" one.

Testing:
------

Run the `run_tests.sh` in the workspace directory. (THIS WORKS).

Implementation Note:
--------------------

The change is in the implementation of _wrap_unique_genrule() which will now
ensure that the symlinks are only created if necessary, i.e. when the target
and current build configurations are different, and will otherwise just pass
the output paths using the DefaultInfo provider.

Note that there is technically now way to know whether a transition function
was invoked from the context of a rule implementation function, so comparing
the target genrule()'s output paths with the ones from the current build
configuration is used.

Issues / Unknowns / Future Work:
--------------------------------

None so far.
